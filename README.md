### Tech <a name="tech"></a>
* **Object Oriented Programming** or **OOP** is a programming approach that focuses on objects. Objects are like building 
blocks that contain both data and actions. By using objects, we can make our code more organized, reusable, and easier to understand and maintain. 
* **Tkinter** is a Python library for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that are widely used and come included with Python distributions. 
It provides a set of pre-built UI components, known as widgets, along with layout managers for arranging them within the application window.
